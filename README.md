This is the simulation results of Case 1 that we used to support our theoretical theorem in the paper "Uniform in time convergence of a tamed-adaptive Euler-Maruyama scheme for SDEs with Markovian switching, under non-Lipschitz conditions" (see https://vjol.info.vn/index.php/DHSPHN-KHTN/article/view/83092 for more details). In our paper, we presented 4 cases to support our results, but the ideas for 4 of them are quite the same, so for the sake of simplicity, we just post the code of the simplest case.
The code is not very technical, we basically calculate the discretized value of the tamed-adaptive E-M scheme to approximate the solution of the SDEwMS, which was presented quite clearly in our paper.
To see the convergence rate, we use the Monte-Carlo method to approximate the Expectation value of the error. This idea is shown through the function MSE that we mentioned in Section 4 of the paper.
